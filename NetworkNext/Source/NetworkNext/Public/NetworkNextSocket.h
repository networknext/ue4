/*
	There are three types of Next sockets in the Network Next UE4 plugin:

		1. Network Next Client
		2. Network Next Server
		3. Passthrough

	Each socket implements *only* UDP datagram support. All TCP style socket support is stubbed out.

	The client socket is used by client when it connects to a server.

	The server socket is used by a listen server.

	The passthrough socket is used for platforms that don't have the Network Next SDK.

	This makes it possible to use the Network Next UE4 plugin, even if some of your platforms aren't supported (yet).

	All other socket use is directed towards the regular platform socket interface and socket types. We do not get in the way of those!
